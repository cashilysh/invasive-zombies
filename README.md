# Invasive Zombies

Minecraft’s zombies have always been predictable — easy to outrun, quick to forget, and powerless against a simple door or wall. Survival was never truly challenging.

**Invasive Zombies** changes all that by making zombies relentless hunters who will stop at nothing to find you.

## Features

- **Relentless Tracking**  
  Once a zombie spots you, it won’t stop. Hiding won’t work—they remember your location and track you relentlessly.

- **Breaking Blocks**  
  Zombies can break through doors and configurable blocks to reach you. Breaking effects and sounds warn you they’re coming.

- **No Safe Place**  
  Nowhere is truly safe unless you build it to be. Your base must be well-fortified to withstand their onslaught.

- **Customizable Settings**  
  Adjust block-breaking capabilities, zombie speed, tracking range, and more to tailor the difficulty to your preference.

- **Multiplayer Support**  
  Compatible with multiplayer servers; however, configuration must be manually edited on the server side.

## Notes

- Zombies may occasionally break random blocks while performing FarBlockSearch
- To access the client-side config screen, **ModMenu** or **ModSettings** and **cloth-config-api** must be installed for your Minecraft version.
