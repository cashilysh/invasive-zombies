# Invasive Zombies

Minecraft’s zombies have always been predictable—easy to outrun, quick to forget, and powerless against a simple door or walls. Survival was never really a challenge.

**Invasive Zombies** changes all of that. Once they spot you, they won’t stop. Hiding won’t work. They track you relentlessly and remember your location.

Even worse, they can break through doors and other configurable blocks to reach you. **There are breaking effects and sounds** that make it clear they’re coming through. Only the right materials can keep them out. **Nowhere is safe unless you build it to be.**

**You can adjust these settings** to control things like block-breaking, zombie speed, tracking range, and more, making the challenge as tough as you want it.
